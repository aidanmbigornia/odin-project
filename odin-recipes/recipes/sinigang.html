    <h4> Ingredients </h4>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Pork-while you can use meatier and leaner parts such as pork shoulder (kasim), I recommend bony cuts such as spare ribs, pork belly with ribs, hocks, knuckles, and tailbone or neck bones for better flavor.
        </li>
        <li>
            Tomatoes- use ripe, juicy tomatoes
        </li>
        <li>
            Onion-peeled and quartered
        </li>
        <li>
            Fish sauce- brings umami flavor; you can swap it with salt if you prefer
        </li>
        <li>
            Gabi- adds a starchy component to the dish and thickens the broth
        </li>
        <li>
            Radish (labanos)
        </li>
        <li>
            Vegetables- the recipe uses sitaw (long beans), eggplant, okra, and bok choy, but feel free to include other local produce available such as kangkong (water spinach) and pechay
        </li>
        <li>
            Tamarind- can be fresh pods, paste, or powder mixes
        </li>
        <li>
            Banana or finger chili peppers (siling haba)-adds a mild heat; optional and can be omitted
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h4> How to make from scratch </h4>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Wash tamarind pods under cold, running water to remove any grit or dirt from the skins.
        </li>
        <li>
            Place in a saucepan with about 1 cup water and bring to a boil. Cook for about 4 to 5 minutes until soft, and the outer skins begin to burst.
        </li>
        <li>
            Using a fork, mash the tamarinds to release the pulp.
        </li>
        <li>
            Place the tamarind and liquid in a fine-mesh strainer set over a bowl. Continue to mash with a fork, returning some of the liquid into the strainer once or twice to fully extract the juice.
        </li>
        <li>
            Discard seeds and skins. Pour tamarind juice into the pot.
        </li>
    </ol>
